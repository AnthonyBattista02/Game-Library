# Game-Library
I am building a game library app. This wil be similar to other sites such as Steam where it will show all of the games that you own as well as relevent information about them and your acheivment progress. In particular it will show the title, description, game tags, publisher details, amount of acheivments available and completed, and an image for the game. The website will contain multiple functions within it such as the ability to set acheivment progress, sort games by genre, and search for, add and remove games found in the created database from the back-end code.
